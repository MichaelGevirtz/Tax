# Rejected Ideas

## Direct API Access to Tax Authority
**Reason:** Unreliable availability, legal uncertainty, high maintenance cost.

## Service-First Model ("We do everything for you") — as primary model
**Reason:** Breaks SaaS margin, adds operational and legal risk.
**Amended (2026-02-08):** A partner-operated service tier is now approved as a *secondary* option. The rejection applies to building service operations in-house or making service the primary product. See `decision-log.md` entry "2026-02-08 – Service Tier as Secondary Revenue Path" for full constraints.

## NoSQL as Primary Database
**Reason:** Weak consistency guarantees for financial/audit data.

## Autonomous Multi-Agent Coding Frameworks
**Reason:** Premature complexity before tests and CI are mature.
