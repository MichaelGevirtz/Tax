# Rejected Ideas

## Direct API Access to Tax Authority
**Reason:** Unreliable availability, legal uncertainty, high maintenance cost.

## Service-First Model ("We do everything for you")
**Reason:** Breaks SaaS margin, adds operational and legal risk.

## NoSQL as Primary Database
**Reason:** Weak consistency guarantees for financial/audit data.

## Autonomous Multi-Agent Coding Frameworks
**Reason:** Premature complexity before tests and CI are mature.
